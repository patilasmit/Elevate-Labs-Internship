🔍 **Key Challenges Addressed:**
- Which products and regions are the most/least profitable?
- How do discounts, shipping modes, and customer segments impact profit?
- Where can we optimize operations and boost margins?

## 📈 Dashboard Goals
- Visualize sales and profit trends across categories, regions, and segments.
- Identify high-performing and underperforming areas in the business.
- Understand how discounts and shipping choices affect profitability.
- Drive better decisions through data-backed insights.

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Phones and Chairs dominate sales; some categories underperform.
- California leads in revenue, but other states show low profit.
- Discounts are a major factor in declining profit margins.
- Standard shipping is the most used but not always most profitable.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Power BI** – Data cleaning, modeling, and visualization
- **DAX** – Calculated measures and KPIs (e.g., Total Sales, Profit)
- **Excel** – Initial dataset exploration

## ✅ Outcomes

This dashboard empowers decision-makers to:
- Optimize product and segment strategies
- Revisit discounting and shipping policies
- Focus on high-potential regions and reduce operational inefficiencies
